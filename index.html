	<p>
	My name is Juan Martinez, I go by many other names. But you may refer to me by that one. I am currently a 
	full-time student, with the occasional odd job to do for student hours or the family. I have a minor background 
	in making backgrounds for games in Blender back in high school game design. Along with helping edit my sister's
	currently dead youtube channel. My main focus in education is CIS (Computer Information systems) I'm able to speak
	both Spanish and English so I can deal with more people (For better or worse) My work and education experiences Include:

	On a more personal level, I am a very quiet guy with a love for playing games and owner of many goofy hats. My main genres 
	being fighting games and RPGs. (got a mean Incineroar in smash ultimate) I also dabble a fair bit in shooters with friends 
	or family, It's the main reason I got an interest in CIS, to begin with. Despite my apparent glare, (just don't see it) I'm 
	not a scary guy. In fact, I have my fair share of dry humor. Finely crafted from years of watching comedians when I was growing
	up. My top 3 include Patrice O' Neal, George Carlin, and Brian Regan. Also, beer is gross and I'm not depressed enough to start
	drinking it.

<h2>
Hows and whys
</h2>

<p>
The Webpage was made entirely in github with no Java integration. It's made to be simple in a glance. Links don't make new window, 
so left click to make a new tab is required to stay on the page. From a stylistic standpoint, the SVG of the circle is supposed to
emulate the sun, to give an oddly satisfying feeling. (at least to me) The Canvas blocks on the listing is to make them sandwiched,
I had debated extending it to the end of the page, but it looked odd. Image choice was an attempt to be funny with the beer crossed
out. (It's still gross.) The video and audio are supposed to go together as a small joke. The video was of yours truly in the bathroom
with my newest silly hat I got in Orlando. It doubled as a video and a way to show my face. I shook my head to make the tail look like
it's swimming. This is to go with the audio of water splashing to make the swimming joke land. Alternatively, I considered the Jaws theme
but the video was too short for it to go any good with it.
