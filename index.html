<h1>About moi</h1> 
  <div id="introduction">
  <p>My name is Juan Martinez, I go by many other names. But you may refer to me by that one. I am currently a full time student,
  with the occasional oddjob to do for student hours or the family. I have a minor background in making backgrounds for games in 
  Blender back in high school game design. My main focus in education is CIS (Computer Information systems) I'm able to speak both
  spanish and english so I can deal with more people (For better or worse) My work and education experiences Include:</p>  
  
  <ul>
   <li>Calculus 1</li>
   <li>COP 1500</li>
   <li>Game Design</li>
   <li>Elementry Calculus</li>
   <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/users/dman1019/achievements">My codecademy</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/284055188/">Scratch Project</a></li>
   </ul>
  
  <p>On a more personal level, I am a very quiet guy with a love for playing games. My main genres being fighting and RPGs. (got a
   mean incineroar in smash ultimate) I also dabble a bit in shooters with friends or family, It's the main reason I got an interest 
   in CIS to begin with. Despite my apparent glare, (just don't see it) I'm not a scary guy. In fact, I have my fair share of dry
   humor. Crafted from years of watching comedians when I was growing up. My top 3 include Patrice O' Neal, George Carlin, and
   Brian Regan. Also beer is gross and I'm not depressed enough to start drinking it. </p>
