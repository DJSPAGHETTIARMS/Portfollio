	<p>
	My name is Juan Martinez, I go by many other names. But you may refer to me by that one. I am currently a 
	full-time student, with the occasional odd job to do for student hours or the family. I have a minor background 
	in making backgrounds for games in Blender back in high school game design. Along with helping edit my sister's
	currently dead youtube channel. My main focus in education is CIS (Computer Information systems) I'm able to speak
	both Spanish and English so I can deal with more people (For better or worse) My work and education experiences Include:

	On a more personal level, I am a very quiet guy with a love for playing games and owner of many goofy hats. My main genres 
	being fighting games and RPGs. (got a mean Incineroar in smash ultimate) I also dabble a fair bit in shooters with friends 
	or family, It's the main reason I got an interest in CIS, to begin with. Despite my apparent glare, (just don't see it) I'm 
	not a scary guy. In fact, I have my fair share of dry humor. Finely crafted from years of watching comedians when I was growing
	up. My top 3 include Patrice O' Neal, George Carlin, and Brian Regan. Also, beer is gross and I'm not depressed enough to start
	drinking it.
