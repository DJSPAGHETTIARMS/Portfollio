<h1>About moi</h1> 
  <p>My name is Juan Martinez, I go by many other names. But you may refer to me by that one. I am currently a full time student,
  with the occasional oddjob to do for student hours or the family. I have a minor background in making backgrounds for games in 
  Blender back in high school game design. My main focus in education is CIS (Computer Information systems) I'm able to speak both
  spanish and english so I can deal with more people (For better or worse)</p>
